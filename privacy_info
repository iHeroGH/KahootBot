Welcome to KahootBot!

To keep it short: KahootBot only stores some channel IDs when you activate "Frenzy Mode" (which randomly sends a Kahoot every few minutes from a list you create into a channel)

KahootBot stores no messages
KahootBot stores no user info (other than your score for a specific Kahoot game at a time, which gets deleted immediately when the game ends)
KahootBot does not affect your Kahoot or Discord account in any way.

The code is public and can be viewed by anyone (including you!) to verify this information.

Feel free to contact me through Discord at Hero#2313 about any privacy concerns


Some general terms of service:
The bot can only be used to get a Kahoot game from https://create.kahoot.it/ and retrieve public information about it or play the Kahoot directly in Discord
Using the bot to attempt to manipulate Kahoot games or the Kahoot website may result in blacklisting from the bot and its services.
